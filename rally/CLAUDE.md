# rally — project rules for Claude

## Feature documentation

- The `features/` folder is the agent-oriented overview of how this project
  works — one file per feature area (car physics, drivetrain, engine, terrain,
  rendering, testing, etc.), indexed in `features/README.md`. Read it first to
  get oriented.
- Every time a feature is added or modified, update the relevant `features/`
  file(s) in the SAME piece of work — keep the docs in sync with the code, the
  same way tests are kept in sync.

## Testing (mandatory)

- When adding or changing functionality, add or update tests in the same piece
  of work: gameplay/logic tests in `tests/headless/`, scene/structure checks in
  `tests/headless/test_smoke.gd`.
- After any change, run `./run_tests.sh` and make sure ALL tests pass before
  declaring the work complete.
- ALWAYS run `./run_tests.sh` in the background (`run_in_background: true`) and
  keep working / wait for the completion notification rather than blocking on
  it. Tests take a while, so never run them in the foreground.
- Be mindful that the FULL test suite takes a while to run. During a long task,
  avoid running the entire suite mid-stream — where you need feedback, run only
  the relevant subset (e.g. the specific test file/script affected by your
  change). Save the full `./run_tests.sh` run for the END of a task, as the final
  verification before declaring the work complete.
- Before starting a test run, check whether a background shell is already
  running `./run_tests.sh`. If one is, do NOT start another — wait for the
  existing run to finish and use its result. Concurrent runs waste resources
  and produce confusing, interleaved output.
- If an existing test breaks, treat the NEW CHANGES as the prime suspect, not
  the test. The tests encode agreed behavior (e.g. W drives the car forward,
  reset returns to start), so a previously-green test failing usually means
  the new changes are no good. Before touching the test, verify whether it
  SHOULD change: did the user explicitly ask for the behavior it asserts to
  change? If yes, update the test and say so in your summary. If no, fix the
  code — never weaken thresholds, flip signs, or delete assertions just to
  get back to green.

## Environment

- Godot binary: `/Users/felixwu/Downloads/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot`
  (override with `$GODOT`). Tests use GUT, vendored in `addons/gut/`.
- This project is intentionally NOT under git. Do not run git commands.
- All gameplay/look tuning values live in `config/game_config.tres`
  (a `GameConfig` resource) — change values there, not in scripts or
  `main.tscn`. Scene/script literals are only fallback defaults.
