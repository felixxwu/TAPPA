# Tire marks (gravel ruts)

`TireMarks` (`scripts/tire_marks.gd`, `class_name TireMarks extends Node3D`) lays
subtle, gravel-coloured ruts behind the car's wheels while it drives on the road.
Created + wired by `world.gd._generate_track` (reused across event regenerations,
re-targeted on a car swap in `world.gd.cycle_car`). See the design in
[../todo/tire-marks.md](../todo/tire-marks.md).

## Why a ribbon mesh

The project renders with `gl_compatibility` (desktop + mobile), which has **no
`Decal` support** — so each wheel gets a **persistent ribbon mesh**: a child
`MeshInstance3D` whose `ArrayMesh` is rebuilt as segments are appended. Same
unshaded, cull-disabled material style as the `wheel_force_debug` overlay, but
accumulated rather than rebuilt-from-scratch each frame.

## Per-tick logic

Each `_physics_process` (skipped when `tire_marks_enabled` is off, the centerline
is missing, or the car is gone):
- **Speed gate** — below `tire_mark_min_speed_mps` every ribbon is broken (no marks
  while parked / during the countdown).
- **Road frame** — one windowed nearest-offset on the centerline for the car centre
  (`_windowed_offset`, the same local-search idea as `TrackProgress`), giving the
  local road point + left normal. Wheels are within a couple of metres, so this one
  frame gates all four.
- **Per wheel** (duck-typed on `is_in_contact()`, so `VehicleWheel3D` and test stubs
  both work): when in contact and within `track_width/2 + tire_mark_gravel_margin_m`
  of the centerline (on the gravel), and it has moved ≥ `tire_mark_segment_step_m`
  since its last point, append a ribbon segment — a left/right pair across the road
  normal at the wheel's ground point (`y = TerrainManager.height_at + tire_mark_ground_offset_m`).
  Off the gravel or airborne, the ribbon **breaks** (a fresh strip starts later, no
  line across the gap).
- **Cap** — each wheel's segment list is a ring buffer of `tire_mark_max_segments`
  (oldest recycled); only the wheel's own surface rebuilds on a new segment. Memory
  is bounded and the chase cam looks forward, so far-behind marks are off-screen.

## Configuration

All in `GameConfig` (the "Tire Marks" group): `tire_marks_enabled`,
`tire_mark_color` (solid, a shade darker than the gravel), `tire_mark_width_m`,
`tire_mark_min_speed_mps`, `tire_mark_segment_step_m`, `tire_mark_max_segments`,
`tire_mark_ground_offset_m`, `tire_mark_gravel_margin_m`.

## Tests

`tests/headless/test_tire_marks.gd` — a straight `Curve2D` + stub car/wheels drive
the logic without a vehicle or rendering: four ribbons collected, marks accumulate
on the gravel, none off it, a sub-step move adds nothing, the ring buffer caps the
count, below the speed floor lays nothing, and an airborne wheel stops marking.

## Out of scope (todo/tire-marks.md)

Per-surface variation (grass/mud), alpha fade-out over distance, and
skid-intensity colouring — gravel-only, uniform, hard-capped for now.
