#
# THE FLAT SHELL: the game's main scene, and the only way into a run.
#
# It replaces the diegetic 3D hub (`hq.tscn`, 3527 lines) and the overworld, both deleted
# in stage 2b of todo/roguelike-pivot-plan.md. Decision 9 chose a flat 2D UI outright, so
# there is no 3D station, no camera pose, no spatial navigation — every screen here is a
# flat MenuPage and every one of them is keyboard + gamepad navigable through
# MenuNav.attach, which CLAUDE.md requires of every menu in the game.
#
# DELIBERATELY PLAIN. Stage 3's bar is "the loop runs start to finish", not "the loop looks
# good": this is four stacked pages of buttons. Stages 4-8 replace the region and car pages
# with real screens (a shop, boost levels, perks, lifetime stats) and this file is expected
# to be rewritten around them. Do not invest in its looks now, and do not grow it into the
# place those features live — give each its own script when it lands.
#
# WHY ONE SCRIPT AND ONE SCENE: the pages share nothing but a host and a back stack, and
# the whole shell is smaller than any one of the nine hub collaborators it replaces.
# Splitting it now would be four files that each do one `for` loop.

# The pages, as a plain stack. `_page` is the live MenuPage; `_view` says which screen it
# is showing, so `_back()` knows where to go and the tests can assert a screen without
# reading button text.

# RunSession is an autoload with no class_name, so its STATIC members must be reached
